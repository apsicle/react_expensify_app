# react_expensify_app
Expensify app - Expense tracking web tool

I made this expense-tracking app as part of the React developer course by Andrew Mead on Udemy.

Add expenses and descriptions to start tracking them. Then, from the dashboard, view, sort, or search through your expenses to find
those most relevant to you. You can sort by date or amount, and also limit your search using our text or date filters. For example,
from the dashboard, enter "rent" into the search bar to find only expenses with the word "rent" in the description. Or, filter by date using
the date picker, and return only the expenses between the dates of your choosing.

Data is stored privately on Firebase, so log in with your google account to start using!
